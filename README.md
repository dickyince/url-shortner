## The Problem

### Context:
Imagine that It's the summer of **2006**. Twitter launched just a few months ago, and "tweeting" has
become all the rage.

### You:
You're a CS undergrad at Stanford University, and you love to tweet all day long with your friends, especially
when you're in class. One thing you find that you're doing a lot is sharing a lot of URLs. Cool blogs you've read and
links to funny cat pictures. But URLs are long and don't leave much room for anything else in your tweet. One
day, you go to paste a Google Maps URL or New York Times article into a tweet, and BAM! You're already over
the 140 character limit. You think: "there's got to be a better way."

### Your Big Idea:
You decide to <ins>**architect**</ins> and <ins>**build**</ins> the world's first URL shortening service. This is going to be your
big start-up idea. You're going to be rich, or at least internet-famous. You have your laptop, 100 dollars (for cloud
hosting, and for GoDaddy to register a domain) and a free weekend. "That's all an entrepreneur needs these
days," you think.

Let's go.
